# Main focus
Predict whether a player will purchase FIFA 21 based on their previous behaviour and interactions with the game.
Use the prediction to target potential customers and increase sales.

# Data Source
Datasets of players who have played FIFA 20 and their features and purchase status for FIFA 21( the features include: FIFA21_purchase_date, id, num_purchases, num_login, extra_content).
The target variable is: purchaseFIFA21, which is a binary indicator of whether the player bought FIFA 21 or not.

# Model Choice and Evaluation Metric
I chose to use a neural network model because it can capture complex and nonlinear relationships between the features and the target.
I used binary crossentropy as the loss function and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
